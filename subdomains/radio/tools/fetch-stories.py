"""Mirrors the Omarchy Stories feed into public/stories/feed.rss.

The player reads the episode list from this repo rather than from the show's
host, because a browser will not read another site's feed unless that site
sends a header saying it may, and Riverside send it on the preflight but not
on the GET a plain read makes. Mirroring the file sidesteps the question: by
the time the player asks, the feed is served from radio.omarchy.org like
everything else. The episode audio still comes from the show's host, so their
download figures still count what they always counted.

Run by .github/workflows/stories.yml every hour, and safe to run by hand:

    python3 tools/fetch-stories.py

It leaves the file alone unless the show actually published something, so an
hourly job does not write 24 commits a day.

The commit is what publishes an episode: the page behind /podcast/<episode> is
written by the build, out of this file, so pushing it is what makes that page
exist. Standard library only.
