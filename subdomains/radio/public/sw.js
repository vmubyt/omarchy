/* Omarchy Radio service worker.

   Caches the shell so the deck opens instantly, works offline and meets the
   install criteria. Audio deliberately never goes near the cache: the tracks
   are served as range requests, and storing a partial response breaks
   seeking.

   The podcast feed is served from here now, mirrored hourly by a workflow, so
   it is cached like the playlist and an episode list is there offline. The
   episode audio is the show's host's and is left alone, like the tracks.

   Every song and every episode is a page of its own, written by the build.
   There are too many to precache and no reason to: a page is cached the first
   time it is opened, and any page never opened falls back to the shell, which
   reads the address and routes itself. Paths are written from the site root
   here, as they are everywhere else, because a page at /playlist/<song> would
   resolve a relative one against /playlist/.

   Bump VERSION to retire every old cache on the next activate. */

     the bundler — so they cannot be listed by name from in here, and do not
     need to be: a stamped address is cached the first time a page asks for
     it, and a changed file is a new address that misses and goes to the
     network. That is what keeps a cached deck from ever being served against
     a page it no longer fits. */
